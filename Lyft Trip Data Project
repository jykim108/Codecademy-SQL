--JOINING MULTIPLE TABLES

--Let’s practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.
--Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:
--trips: trips information
--riders: user data
--cars: autonomous cars


--Let’s examine the three tables. What are the column names?

--trips columns: id, date, pickup, dropoff, rider_id, car_id, type, cost
--riders columns: first, last, username, rating, total_trips, referred
--cars columns: model, OS, status, trips_completed
