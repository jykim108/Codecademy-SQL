--CALCULATING AGGREGATES

--Howdy! It’s your first day as a TechCrunch reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.
--To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a project.sqlite file that contains a table called startups. 
--It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.
--Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.

--Getting started, take a look at the startups table:

SELECT *
FROM startups;

--How many columns are there? name, location, category, employees, raised, valuation, founded, stage, ceo, info


--Calculate the total number of companies in the table.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM startups;

--Yields: 70


--We want to know the total value of all companies in this table. Calculate this by getting the SUM() of the valuation column.

SELECT SUM(valuation)
FROM startups;

--Yields: 974455790000


--What is the highest amount raised by a startup? Return the maximum amount of money raised.

SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups;

--Yields: 11500000000


--Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.

SELECT MAX(raised)
FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';

--Yields: 1800000


--In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?

SELECT MIN(founded)
FROM startups;


--Return the average valuation.

SELECT AVG(valuation)
FROM startups;

--Yields: 15974685081.9672


--Return the average valuation, in each category. Round the averages to two decimal places.
--Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.

SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


--First, return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.

SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1;


--Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them. What are the most competitive markets?

SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;

--Yields:
category	COUNT(*)
Education	  5
Mobile	    10
Social	    12


--What is the average size of a startup in each location?

SELECT location, ROUND(AVG(employees),0)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1;


--What is the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500?

SELECT location, ROUND(AVG(employees),0)
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
