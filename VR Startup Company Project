--JOINING MULTIPLE TABLES

--Codecademy Virtual Reality (CVR), Inc. is the latest startup on the VR scene. 
--As head of the Project Completion team, you have been given a list of upcoming projects needing to be delivered. 
--Your main responsibility is to analyze our current talent pool to ensure each project can be completed efficiently and effectively.
--Each project needs a Project Manager, Team Lead, Designer, Database Administrator (DBA), and at least two Developers.

--Start by familiarizing yourself with the tables. Examine the data from the employees table.

SELECT * 
FROM employees;

--employees columns: employee_id, first_name, last_name, location, position, personality, current_project


--Examine the data in the projects table. Do you think there’s a way to join the two tables?

SELECT * 
FROM projects;

--projects columns: project_id, project_name, start_date, end_date
--INNER JOIN could show which employees are working on which project


--What are the names of employees who have not chosen a project?

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE current_project IS NULL;


--What are the names of projects that were not chosen by any employees?

SELECT project_name
FROM projects 
WHERE project_id NOT IN (
  SELECT current_project
  FROM employees
  WHERE current_project IS NOT NULL
);


--What is the name of the project chosen by the most employees?

SELECT project_name, COUNT(*)
FROM projects
INNER JOIN employees
  ON projects.project_id = employees.current_project
WHERE current_project IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY project_name
ORDER BY COUNT(employee_id) DESC
LIMIT 1;

--Yields:
[project_name	  COUNT(*)
FistsOfFury 	    5]


--Which projects were chosen by multiple employees?

SELECT project_name, COUNT(*)
FROM projects
INNER JOIN employees
  ON projects.project_id = employees.current_project
WHERE current_project IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY current_project
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) > 1;

--Yields:
[project_name	  COUNT(*)
RocketRush	      3
ExtremeJets	      2
FistsOfFury	      5]


--Each project needs at least 2 developers. How many available project positions are there for developers? 
--Do we have enough developers to fill the needed positions?

SELECT (COUNT(*) * 2) - (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM employees
  WHERE current_project IS NOT NULL
    AND position = 'Developer') AS 'Count'
FROM projects;


--When employees are hired at CVR, they are given the Myers-Briggs personality test. 
--We try to diminish tension among team members by creating teams based on compatible personalities.
--The chart shows which personality matches should be avoided. 
--For example, an employee with the ISFP personality type should not be matched with an INFP, ENFP, or an INFJ.

SELECT personality, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY personality
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;

--Yields: ENFJ count of 7


--What are the names of projects chosen by employees with the most common personality type?

SELECT projects.project_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN projects
  ON employees.current_project = projects.project_id;
  
--Project names: RocketRush, ZombieStorm, MMA2K, ExtremeJets, BravoBoxing, AlienInvasion, FistsofFury


--Find the personality type most represented by employees with a selected project.
--What are names of those employees, the personality type, and the names of the project they’ve chosen?

SELECT first_name, last_name, personality, project_name, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
INNER JOIN projects
  ON employees.current_project = projects.project_id
WHERE personality = (
  SELECT personality 
  FROM employees
  WHERE current_project IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY personality
  ORDER BY COUNT(personality) DESC
  LIMIT 1);
  
--Yields: 
[first_name	  last_name	  personality 	project_name	COUNT(*)
Shannan	       Arlow	        ISTJ	     RocketRush	    3]


--For each employee, provide their name, personality, the names of any projects they’ve chosen, and the number of incompatible co-workers.
