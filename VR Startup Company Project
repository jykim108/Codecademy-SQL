--JOINING MULTIPLE TABLES

--Codecademy Virtual Reality (CVR), Inc. is the latest startup on the VR scene. 
--As head of the Project Completion team, you have been given a list of upcoming projects needing to be delivered. 
--Your main responsibility is to analyze our current talent pool to ensure each project can be completed efficiently and effectively.
--Each project needs a Project Manager, Team Lead, Designer, Database Administrator (DBA), and at least two Developers.

--Start by familiarizing yourself with the tables. Examine the data from the employees table.

SELECT * 
FROM employees;

--employees columns: employee_id, first_name, last_name, location, position, personality, current_project


--Examine the data in the projects table. Do you think thereâ€™s a way to join the two tables?

SELECT * 
FROM projects;

--projects columns: project_id, project_name, start_date, end_date
--INNER JOIN could show which employees are working on which project


--What are the names of employees who have not chosen a project?

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE current_project IS NULL;


--What are the names of projects that were not chosen by any employees?

SELECT project_name
FROM projects 
WHERE project_id NOT IN (
  SELECT current_project
  FROM employees
  WHERE current_project IS NOT NULL
);


--What is the name of the project chosen by the most employees?

SELECT project_name, COUNT(*)
FROM projects
INNER JOIN employees
  ON projects.project_id = employees.current_project
WHERE current_project IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY project_name
ORDER BY COUNT(employee_id) DESC
LIMIT 1;

--Yields:
[project_name	  COUNT(*)
FistsOfFury 	    5]
