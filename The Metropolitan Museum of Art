--CALCULATING AGGREGATES

--The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York is one of the world’s largest and finest art museums.
--In this project, you will be working with a table named met that contains the museum’s collection of American Decorative Arts.

--Start by getting a feel for the met table:

SELECT *
FROM met
LIMIT 10;

--What are the column names? id, department, category, title, artist, date, medium, country


--How many pieces are in the American Decorative Art collection?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM met;


--Celery was considered a luxurious snack in the Victorian era (around the 1800s). Wealthy families served stalks of it in intricate glass vases.
--Don’t believe it? Count the number of pieces where the category includes ‘celery’.

SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE category LIKE '%celery%';

--Yields: 31


--Find the title and medium of the oldest piece(s) in the collection.

SELECT title, medium, MIN(date)
FROM met;

--Yields: 
title	      medium	MIN(date)
Betty Lamp	Iron	1600–1700

SELECT title, medium, date
FROM met
WHERE date LIKE '%1600%';

--Yields multiple paintings, like Betty Lamp, Candlestick, Casement Window, Rack, and Hanging Candlestick


--Not every American decoration is from the Americas… where are they are coming from? Find the top 10 countries with the most pieces in the collection.

SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM met
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;


--There are all kinds of American decorative art in the Met’s collection. Find the categories HAVING more than 100 pieces.

SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM met
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;


--Lastly, let’s look at some bling! Count the number of pieces where the medium contains ‘gold’ or ‘silver’. And sort in descending order.

SELECT medium, COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE medium LIKE '%gold%'
   OR medium LIKE '%silver%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
