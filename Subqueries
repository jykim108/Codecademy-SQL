--SUBQUERIES

--As the name suggests, a subquery is an internal query nested inside of an external query. They can be nested inside of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.
--Anytime a subquery is present, it gets executed before the external statement is run.
--Complete the subquery to find students taking both band and drama.

[SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM band_students
WHERE id IN (
   ...
   ...);]

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM band_students
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id
  FROM drama_students
);


--A memo was recently released stating that 9th grade students are unable to take both drama and band concurrently. 
--The students currently enrolled in both classes will be dropped from drama and remain in band.
--Write a DELETE query that will remove 9th grade students enrolled in both band and drama from the drama_students table.

DELETE FROM drama_students
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id 
  FROM band_students
);


--COMPARISON OPERATORS

--Emlynne Torritti (id 20), has decided to drop band and join drama. She wants to know how many other students in her grade level are already enrolled in drama.
--Use a subquery to find the students enrolled in drama that are in the same grade as Emlynne.

SELECT *
FROM drama_students
WHERE grade = (
  SELECT grade
  FROM band_students
  WHERE id = 20
);


--IN AND NOT CLAUSES

--When an IN clause is used, results retrieved from the external query must appear within the subquery results. 
--Similarly, when a NOT IN clause is used, results retrieved from the external query must not appear within the subquery results.

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM band_students
WHERE id 
NOT IN (
  SELECT id
  FROM drama_students
);


--EXISTS AND NOT EXISTS

--Recall that when a subquery is included, the inner query runs before the external query. 
--When the inner query is included using an IN or NOT IN clause, all rows meeting the inner query’s criteria are returned.
--They are then compared against the external query’s criteria. 
--However, when the inner query is included using an EXISTS or NOT EXISTS clause, we are only checking for the presence of rows meeting the specified criteria.
--The inner query only returns a true or false.
--If we compare this functionality in terms of efficiency, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS are usually more efficient than IN/NOT IN clauses.
--This is because the IN/NOT IN clause has to return all rows meeting the specific criteria
--whereas the EXISTS/NOT EXISTS only needs to find the presence of one row to determine if a true or false value needs to be returned.

--Write a query to find out which grade levels are represented in both band and drama.

SELECT grade
FROM band_students
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT grade
  FROM drama_students
);
