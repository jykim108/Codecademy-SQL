--SUBQUERIES

--As the name suggests, a subquery is an internal query nested inside of an external query. They can be nested inside of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.
--Anytime a subquery is present, it gets executed before the external statement is run.
--Complete the subquery to find students taking both band and drama.

[SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM band_students
WHERE id IN (
   ...
   ...);]

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM band_students
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id
  FROM drama_students
);


--A memo was recently released stating that 9th grade students are unable to take both drama and band concurrently. 
--The students currently enrolled in both classes will be dropped from drama and remain in band.
--Write a DELETE query that will remove 9th grade students enrolled in both band and drama from the drama_students table.

DELETE FROM drama_students
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id 
  FROM band_students
);
