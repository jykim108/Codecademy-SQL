--QUERIES CHALLENGE


--BABY NAMES INTRODUCTION
--In this Code Challenge, you will be querying data from three different datasets:

Baby Names
Restaurants
News Headlines

--In the first one, you will be performing analysis on U.S. baby names. 
--You’ll start with a table named babies with four columns: name, year, gender, number.

--Find the number of girls who were named Lillian for the full span of time of the database. Select only the year and number columns.

SELECT year, number
FROM babies
WHERE name = 'Lillian';


--Find 20 distinct names that start with ‘S’. Select only the name column.

SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM babies
WHERE name LIKE 'S%'
LIMIT 20;


--What are the top 10 names in 1880? Select the name, gender, and number columns.

SELECT name, gender, number
FROM babies
WHERE year=1880
ORDER BY number DESC
LIMIT 10;


--RESTAURANTS INTRODUCTION
--Next up, you will be querying data on restaurants. We need your help to answer some questions and find the best dinner spots in the city!
--You’ll work with a table named nomnom with six columns: name, neighborhood, cuisine, review, price, and health columns.

--Suppose your friend Jaime wants to go out to Japanese, but you’re on a budget. Return all the restaurants that are Japanese and $$.
--Select all the columns.

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Japanese' AND price = '$$';


--Your roommate Bevers can’t remember the exact name of a restaurant he went to but he knows it contains the word ‘noodle’ in it.
--Can you find it for him using a query? Select all the columns.

 SELECT * 
 FROM nomnom
 WHERE name LIKE '%noodle%';
 
 
 --Some of the restaurants have not been inspected yet or are currently appealing their health grade score.
 --Find the restaurants that have empty health values. Select all the columns.
 
 SELECT *
 FROM nomnom
 WHERE health IS NULL;
 
 
 --NEWS HEADLINES INTRODUCTION
 --There is a table called news with six columns. It is full of news article headlines from different publishing companies!
 --Order the table by title (from A-Z). Select only the title and publisher columns.
 
SELECT title, publisher
FROM news 
ORDER BY title;


--Which article names have the word 'bitcoin' in it? Select all the columns.

SELECT *
FROM news 
WHERE title LIKE '%bitcoin%';


--The category column contains the article category:
'b' stands for Business
't' stands for Technology
--What are the 20 business articles published most recently? Select all the columns.

SELECT *
FROM news
WHERE category = 'b'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;


--Feel free to experiment more with all three tables. For example:

--Is your name in babies?
--How many babies were given your name?
--What are the top 5 restaurants in nomnom?
--What are the top 5 Chinese restaurants?
--Which articles are from Wall Street Journal in news?
--Which technology articles are from Wall Street Journal?

SELECT *
FROM babies
WHERE name LIKE 'Jessica';
 
SELECT SUM(number)
FROM babies
WHERE name LIKE 'Jessica';
 
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
ORDER BY review DESC
LIMIT 5;
 
SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Chinese'
ORDER BY review DESC
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM news
WHERE publisher LIKE '%Wall Street Journal%';

SELECT *
FROM news
WHERE publisher LIKE '%Wall Street Journal%' AND category = 't';
