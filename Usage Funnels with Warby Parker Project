--ANALYZE REAL DATA WITH SQL

--To help users find their perfect frame, Warby Parker has a Style Quiz that has the following questions:
--“What are you looking for?”
--“What’s your fit?”
--“Which shapes do you like?”
--“Which colors do you like?”
--“When was your last eye exam?”
--The users’ responses are stored in a table called survey.
--Select all columns from the first 10 rows. What columns does the table have?

 SELECT *
 FROM survey
 LIMIT 10;
 
 --columns: question, user_id, response
 
 
 --Users will “give up” at different points in the survey. Let’s analyze how many users move from Question 1 to Question 2, etc.
--Create a quiz funnel using the GROUP BY command.
--What is the number of responses for each question?

 SELECT question, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
 FROM survey
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 2 DESC;
 
 
 --Warby Parker’s purchase funnel is: Take the Style Quiz → Home Try-On → Purchase the Perfect Pair of Glasses
--During the Home Try-On stage, we will be conducting an A/B Test:
--50% of the users will get 3 pairs to try on
--50% of the users will get 5 pairs to try on
--Let’s find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on at home will be more likely to make a purchase.
--The data will be distributed across three tables: quiz, home_try_on, purchase
--Examine the first five rows of each table. What are the column names?

SELECT *
FROM quiz
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM home_try_on
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM purchase
LIMIT 5;

--columns of quiz: user_id, style, fit
--columns of home_try_on: user_id, number_of_pairs, address
--columns of purchase: user_id, product_id, style


--Each row will represent a single user from the browse table:
--If the user has any entries in home_try_on, then is_home_try_on will be True.
--number_of_pairs comes from home_try_on table
--If the user has any entries in purchase, then is_purchase will be True.
--Use a LEFT JOIN to combine the three tables, starting with the top of the funnel (quiz) and ending with the bottom of the funnel (purchase).
--Select only the first 10 rows from this table (otherwise, the query will run really slowly).
