--ANALYZE REAL DATA WITH SQL

--To help users find their perfect frame, Warby Parker has a Style Quiz that has the following questions:
--“What are you looking for?”
--“What’s your fit?”
--“Which shapes do you like?”
--“Which colors do you like?”
--“When was your last eye exam?”
--The users’ responses are stored in a table called survey.
--Select all columns from the first 10 rows. What columns does the table have?

 SELECT *
 FROM survey
 LIMIT 10;
 
 --columns: question, user_id, response
 
 
--Users will “give up” at different points in the survey. Let’s analyze how many users move from Question 1 to Question 2, etc.
--Create a quiz funnel using the GROUP BY command.
--What is the number of responses for each question?

SELECT question, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM survey
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
 
 
 --Warby Parker’s purchase funnel is: Take the Style Quiz → Home Try-On → Purchase the Perfect Pair of Glasses
--During the Home Try-On stage, we will be conducting an A/B Test:
--50% of the users will get 3 pairs to try on
--50% of the users will get 5 pairs to try on
--Let’s find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on at home will be more likely to make a purchase.
--The data will be distributed across three tables: quiz, home_try_on, purchase
--Examine the first five rows of each table. What are the column names?

SELECT *
FROM quiz
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM home_try_on
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM purchase
LIMIT 5;

--columns of quiz: user_id, style, fit
--columns of home_try_on: user_id, number_of_pairs, address
--columns of purchase: user_id, product_id, style


--Each row will represent a single user from the browse table:
--If the user has any entries in home_try_on, then is_home_try_on will be True.
--number_of_pairs comes from home_try_on table
--If the user has any entries in purchase, then is_purchase will be True.
--Use a LEFT JOIN to combine the three tables, starting with the top of the funnel (quiz) and ending with the bottom of the funnel (purchase).
--Select only the first 10 rows from this table (otherwise, the query will run really slowly).

SELECT q.user_id, h.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_home_try_on', number_of_pairs, p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
FROM quiz AS 'q'
LEFT JOIN home_try_on AS 'h'
  ON q.user_id = h.user_id
LEFT JOIN purchase AS 'p'
  ON q.user_id = p.user_id
LIMIT 10;


--Once we have the data in this format, we can analyze it in several ways:
--We can calculate overall conversion rates by aggregating across all rows.
--We can compare conversion from quiz→home_try_on and home_try_on→purchase.
--We can calculate the difference in purchase rates between customers who had 3 number_of_pairs with ones who had 5.
--We can also use the original tables to calculate things like:
--The most common results of the style quiz.
--The most common types of purchase made.
--What are some actionable insights for Warby Parker?
